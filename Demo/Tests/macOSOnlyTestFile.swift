// While I don't know why, The.framework is built linked to libswiftAppKit.
// Frameworks do not embed the Swift libraries themselves, it's up to the host
// app to include the necessary libraries. So here we are, including AppKit on
// behalf of The.framework so that the tests can run.

    override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()
        // Put setup code here. This method is called before the invocation of each test method in the class.
    }
    
    override func tearDown() {
        // Put teardown code here. This method is called after the invocation of each test method in the class.
        super.tearDown()

        // Use XCTAssert and related functions to verify your tests produce the correct results.
